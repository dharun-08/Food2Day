         <p>This easy Tomato Soup recipe makes a creamy, rich tomato soup that’s perfect for enjoying as a hearty lunch or light dinner. Zesty fresh tomatoes and real cream create a truly comforting, velvety smooth tomato soup from scratch – in less than 30 minutes. My tried-and-true instructions with photos and video even include steps for making the best homemade bread croutons with barely any effort!
            Smooth, savory tomato soup is a delicious dish that is great to enjoy anytime of the year. The bold, bright flavor of fresh tomato is wonderful in the spring and summer, and the creamy richness of the broth makes it the perfect comfort food for a cold fall or winter night. There’s never a time I’m not craving a bowl!

Although this is an easy recipe to make, it does need to be just right to be a truly great tomato soup. Too thick or too thin and it will lose its magic.

Follow my simply step-by-step recipe for making the most luscious and flavorful tomato soup you’ve ever had!

This updated soup recipe is similar to the recipe which I had originally posted, but only the method of preparation has changed. There is no cornstarch added in this one and all the smoothness and creaminess comes from blending the onions, tomatoes and addition of cream.
