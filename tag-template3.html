         <p>Prime rib is an extremely tender, unbelievably juicy cut of beef with a bold flavor that needs no dressing up. In fact, cooking prime rib is one of the easiest things you can do in the kitchen. Here's all you need to know to make the perfect prime rib, along with tried and beloved prime rib recipes.


A cow has 13 ribs on each side. Ribs six through 12 are classified as the "rib primal section." So prime rib refers to the bone-in roast from the rib primal section. Prime rib is sometimes also referred to as the "standing rib roast." But note that "prime" here doesn't refer to USDA Prime beef. More on that below.

Shopping for Prime Rib
Shopping for a roast can be confusing because the very same cut of meat goes by several different names. "Prime rib" is the most famous term, but the word "prime" can actually describe the grade of the meat as well. (The top three grades of beef are Prime, Choice, and Select.)

Meats graded "Prime" are sold almost exclusively to restaurants, so you probably won't find them at the grocery store. Instead, look for roasts labeled "rib roast", "eye of the rib roast", or "standing rib roast."

A boneless rib roast may be called "eye of the rib" roastâ€”or if the ribs are still attached, a "standing rib" roast. The meat will be more flavorful if you roast it with the ribs still attached, but a boneless roast is definitely easier to carve. If you buy a roast with the ribs attached, have the butcher remove the backbone, or the roast will be difficult to carve.</p>
