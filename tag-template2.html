         <p>Pork can make a weeknight dinner feel like a true event, but the other white meat has so much more to offer than just pork chops. These variations, like Vietnamese braised pork belly and our best-ever chorizo, will spice up your holiday spreads and summer BBQsâ€”whenever the mood for pork tenderloin, pulled pork, or roast pork loin strikes.

We know that pork gets a bad rap for being tricky to cook, but we're here to bust that myth. Pork is such a versatile protein no matter how you flavor it or what cooking method you choose. Slow-cook your next pork roast, grill up some pork tenderloin (with plenty of chimichurri!), or even air-fry some pork chops. We love how much rich heartiness pork adds to a wide variety of dishes, like our green chili pork stew, homemade shoyu ramen, and tacos al pastor.

With so many cuts to choose from, there's a pork dish for practically every day of the month. And not just for special occasions either! Our pork fried rice, slow roasted pork and peppers, and sheet-pan pork chops with apples are easy repeat favorites for a reason.

Whether you've got pork chops or baby back ribs on the menu, you've got to have some worthy side dishes to complete your dinner. We've rounded up all our favorite side dishes for pork no matter what flavor-direction you take, from classic mashed potatoes and Instant Pot applesauce to miso roasted carrots and beer braised cabbage.</p>
